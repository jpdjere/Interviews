## 30 Behavioral Interview Questions You Should Be Ready to Answer

**Teamwork**
For questions like these, you want a story that illustrates your ability to work with others under challenging circumstances. Think team conflict, difficult project constraints, or clashing personalities.

* Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

* Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?

* Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?

* We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.

* Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

This actually happens a lot, especially if you work in a big organization like Zalando, and you need to get information of how one of the many moving parts works or how it can be modified, improved. So the first thing that I do when I need to contact someone who isn't particulary responsive is to define my question or requirement to make it as clear, simple and answerable as possible. Then, I research the most I can on who this person is, what their role is, who their colleagues are, and what their product is, so that I can adapt and contextualize my question to this knowledge, to further increase my chance of getting a response.


**Client-facing Skills**
If the role you’re interviewing for works with clients, definitely be ready for one of these. Find an example of a time where you successfully represented your company or team and delivered exceptional customer service.

* Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
  
* Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?

Cognitiva, clientes que piensa que el modelo se entrenaba solo.
Explicacion de que no lo hacemos porque:
 - chatbot aprende por afuera de su domain knowledge
 - chatbot aprende cosas irrelevantes, ofensiva
Explicacion de que parte de nuestro servicio was "a more curated" continous retraining of the chatbot, based on the client's FAQ, most important topics addressed and where the robot had diffciulties.
We aligned with the client a every two week retraining of the model. The client's tracking department would available to us the information we needed to train the model, and us doing the process of this data and the retraining itself.

* Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.

* Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
  
* When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

**Ability to Adapt**
Times of turmoil are finally good for something! Think of a recent work crisis you successfully navigated. Even if your navigation didn’t feel successful at the time, find a lesson or silver lining you took from the situation.

* Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?

Usually at Zalando the period leading up to Cyberweek can mean a lot of pressure. This happened last year as:
- Codefreeze installed which product is sometimes not aware of
- New features triy to be pushed at the last moment
- SRE tasks have to be done simultanousley to guarantee a succesfull CW, such as Load Test and fail safe scenarios.
What I usually try to do, and what worked pretty good is:
- list tasks according to priority and feasibility
- list avaialble resources both internal and external
- decide with product and business which tasks can and should be done, which others can be resolved in some other way (config, etc, not involving coding) and which tasks should be postponed to after CW.
This led to a succesful CW, we reached all the deadlines for the feautres and they pushed our Plus new clients by 20k+ in a single week.

  
* Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?

* Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?

* Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
  
* Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?


**Time Management Skills**
In other words, get ready to talk about a time you juggled multiple responsibilities, organized it all (perfectly), and completed everything before the deadline.

* Tell me about a time you had to be very strategic in order to meet all your top priorities.

* Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

* Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?

* Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring that you would meet your objective?

* Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?

**Communication Skills**
You probably won’t have any trouble thinking of a story for communication questions, since it’s not only part of most jobs; it’s part of everyday life. However, the thing to remember here is to also talk about your thought process or preparation.

* Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.

* Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?

* Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.

* Give me an example of a time when you had to explain something fairly complex to a frustrated client. How did you handle this delicate situation?

HISTORIA DEL CHATBOT Y LOS CLIENTES QUE PIENSAN QUE APRENDEN SOLO. LO MISMO QUE ARRIBA.

* Tell me about a successful presentation you gave and why you think it was a hit.


**Motivation and Values**
A lot of seemingly random interview questions are actually attempts to learn more about what motivates you. Your response would ideally address this directly even if the question wasn’t explicit about it.

* Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.

* Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.

* Tell me about a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision. How did you handle that?

* Give me an example of a time you were able to be creative with your work. What was exciting or difficult about it?

* Tell me about a time you were dissatisfied in your work. What could have been done to make it better?
