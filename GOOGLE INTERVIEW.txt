QUESTIONS FOR CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS ENGINEER
1.
Applied online, contacted by recruiter who went through initial phone screen.
Recruiter set up Google Hangout interview. I was asked questions ranging from technical skills to project management skills.
Then we had a shared Google Doc and went through some programming questions where I needed to code on the fly. Most were dealing with associative arrays.
After that interview, I was contacted again by the recruiter to go through another round of interviews.
I had a second Google Hangout interview with someone holding the same position I was applying for. 
Interview was the same layout as before, but the same topics were not covered.
After about a week, the recruiter contacted me and let me know they hired someone else.
Nothing really unexpected, I wish I had brushed up more on networking topics, but I focused mainly on OO programming.  

2.
Had a 30 minute phone interview. The job description was pretty vague online, so we talked casually about my background. 
She asked some questions about my technical ability, including questions about:
1. Arrays / variables / loops / program flow
2. data structures (heaps / trees / OOP)
3. Big-O Notation
4. Web technologies
5. Data flow & client server models.
6. TCP/IP
7. DB Design
8. SQL

3.
The interviewer finded me on LinkedIn, and schedule a phone screen interview.
Some personal questions and questions about my professional historic, but focused on my techinical past (as developer/software engineer, 
asking about what languages I had developed, etc.).
After this first interview, the interviewer schedule a second interview. The second interview lastest 45 minutes, focused only in technical questions.
Unlike the first interview, the second one was 90% of the questions about Network, wich I thought really weird.
What happens when you type "google.com" in your browser. The whole process since you press 'Enter' until the website appears on yout browser.  

Explain the existing protocols. (http, tcp, ip, udp, smtp, ftp, etc, etc, etc ...).  

Explain 'DNS'.  

If you had a service every day you showed a different image, and after 6 months, the service stopped working on the site of only one of the clients,
how would you resolve it? The client don't know anything about IT, VPN, access remote. In this questions, the interviewer wanted a Troubleshooting.  

The interviewer showed me a database, and ask me to run a few selects.
